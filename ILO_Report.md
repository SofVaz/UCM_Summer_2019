Abstract
========

This document presents a brief overview of the current state of the *Intended Learning Objectives* (hereafter *ILO*). Including information on:

-   The number of ILOs in our courses.

-   The orientation of language used in ILOs

-   The most common capacities the ILOs promote broken down by Level and Concentration

-   \[NOT DONE YET\] A description of how the current objectives map to Bloom's Taxonomy of learning.

-   \[NOT DONE YET\] Recommendations on how to write ILOs

-   \[NOT DONE YET\] Suggested rephrasing of current ILO's

A brief overview of our data
============================

For this analysis I used the *ILOs* for the year *2018/2019* provided by Edith. The *ILOs* of the projects (PRO) were missing from this file, and have therefore not been included in the subsequent analysis. I did have the *ILOs* for the Undergraduate Research Projects (UGR), so these are inlcuded.
The data contained a total of **141** **courses**, which amounted to **625** **ILOs**. All quotes from *ILOs* are referenced with base to the `ILOs_2018_2019.docx` document.

How many of ILOs do our courses have? (distribution per course)
---------------------------------------------------------------

In general, the courses had an average of 4.4 *ILOs* per course. Which were distributed as follows:

A breakdown by Level and Concentration gives:

With what orientation are they written? (Student vs. Course)
------------------------------------------------------------

It was possible to distinguish two categories in the way *ILOs* were formulated. *ILOs* were either as student (S) oriented or course (C) oriented. **Student oriented** *ILOs* described what the student was supposed to achieve or have learned during the course, whilst **course oriented** *ILOs* described the aims of the course. For example:

1.  Student Oriented *ILO*:

> “To offer a broad overview of scientific models” (COR1005, p. 1)
> “To acquaint students with the problems…” (HUM2030, p.3)
> “To enhance their research skills” (SKI1009, p.11)

1.  Course Oriented *ILO*:

> “Apply basic bookkeeping techniques” (SSC2022, p.15)
> “To reflect on the relevance and utility of social theory in general”(SSC2028, p.15)

A few courses had some *ILOs* formulated in a student oriented fashion and others *ILOs* in a course oriented fashion. Thus, overview bellow is done at a granularity of *ILO* not courses.

In general, this is what we have in the curriculum in raw numbers:

In percentages, we have the following:

Analysing our ILOs
==================

Methodology
-----------

### Phase 1- Verb extraction

In order to get a better grasp of the characterization of our *ILOs*, I manually went through all *ILOs* and extracted the verb(s) describing what the student was supposed to do in each *ILO*. This created a distiction between the course verb and the student verb, as well as between the `action verb` and the `intended verb`. For instance:

**1. Course verb/Student verb:**
For the ILO "to provide students with \[...\] perspectives to examine..." (COR1004, p.1) the extracted verb is "\[to\] examine" not "\[to\] provide".

**2. Action verb/Intended verb:** For the ILO "to have the ability to interpret dynamical phenomena..."(SCI3006, p. 9) the verb "\[to\] interpret" was extracted not "\[to\] have (the ability)".

In cases where the verb used was missleading, descriptive words were included. For instance, in the ILO "Gain basic knowledge in using economic/statistical data and present them in an informative way" (SSC2038, p. 15), the words "Gain basic knowledge" were recorded, as opposed to simply "\[to\] gain". For this specific ILO, the verbs "use" and "present" were also extracted, as each ILO could have more than one verb associated to them.

During this phase I tried to keep as close as possible to the original formulation, although as I advanced through the *ILOs* I started to adapt some of the formulations to create some consistency with previously encountered data. Thus, particularily at the end formulations such as "to perform an analysis" were simply extracted as "analyse". Moreover, because of this fidelity principle, some of the verbs for ilos were not verbs at all but conveyed the expected outcome. For instance, "overview" was extracted from the following ILO: "To give an overview over the different media platforms and media practices" (HUM2022, p.3), since the student was suppoded to 'get an overview'.

This phase was performed in Excel and all extracted verbs were recorded in the same row as the original formulation, so it is possible to trace back the work and contest my check my interpretations.

In the following list, it is possible to see all the verbs that were extracted:

### Phase 2- Standardisation

As you can see, some verbs are really similar. For example, we have: "to understand", "understand" and "basic understanding". Therefore, in `Phase 2` I standardised some of the vocabulary. All of the previous words were replaced by the same words: "understand". Here is an overview of the replacements:

    ## [1] "The verbs that were taken to be the same as \"understand\" are: to understand, to develop understanding, basic understanding, understand, gain understanding, develop own understaning, understand (critically)"

    ## [1] "The verbs that were taken to be the same as \"know\" are: to know, to have knowledge, basic knowledge, know, obtain basic knowledge"

    ## [1] "The verbs that were taken to be the same as \"[gain] familiarity\" are: familiarize, [gain] familiarity"

    ## [1] "The verbs that were taken to be the same as \"analyse\" are: develop own analysis, analyse, critically analyse"

    ## [1] "The verbs that were taken to be the same as \"[be] introduced\" are: introduce, [get] introduction, basic introduction"

    ## [1] "The verbs that were taken to be the same as \"[get] overview\" are: get overview, [get] overview"

    ## [1] "The verbs that were taken to be the same as \"[get] acquainted\" are: acquaint, get acquainted"

The result is a table like this:

### Rough numeric overview:

After the previous methodology has been applied, we have 771 individual capacity learning objectives (hereafter capacities). These are the abilities we intend to promote in our students according to our learning objectives and correspond to individual "verbs" (e.g. "understand", "analyse"). The breakdown by level is as follows:

**Level 1000:** 123 capacities

**Level 2000:** 387 capacities.

**Level 3000:** 123 capacities.

##### Graphically:
